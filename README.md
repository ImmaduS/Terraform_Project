##Deploy a Multi-Region High Availability Infrastructure. 

Designing and implementing infrastructure Using terraform to ensure provisioning on AWS. 
It will be using VPC peering, route 53, Auto Scaling groups, RDS Multi-az and s3 rerplication.
Creating a GitHub README file for your Terraform project that deploys a high availability AWS infrastructure is an essential step in documenting your project and making it accessible to others. Below is a sample README file that you can use as a template. Be sure to customize it with your project-specific details and instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured with the necessary permissions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your high availability AWS infrastructure project up and running.

### Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ImmaduS/Terraform_Project.git
cd Terraform_Project
```

### Terraform Initialization

Initialize your Terraform project:

```shell
terraform init
```

### Configuration

Review and customize the configuration files to match your high availability infrastructure requirements. These files are typically located in the `terraform/` directory.

## Usage

Follow these steps to deploy and manage your high availability AWS infrastructure.

### Deploy High Availability Infrastructure

Use Terraform to create the high availability resources:

```shell
terraform apply
```

### Tear Down Infrastructure

To destroy the resources and clean up, run:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Architecture Overview

Provide a high-level overview of the architecture you are deploying with this project. Explain the key components and their interactions.

## Configuration

Here are some key configuration files in this project:

- `terraform/main.tf`: Main configuration file for your high availability infrastructure.
- `terraform/variables.tf`: Define variables and defaults for your infrastructure.

You can customize these files to suit your specific high availability infrastructure needs.
